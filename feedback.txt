For the comments, suggestions, and recommendations, our group believe it is safe to say that everyone, including
the other groups, did a great job. The things needed to work on, skills-wise and project-wise, 
were already addressed during the presentation. We really can't comment on how the group worked and how 
they approached the requirements, considering the fact that this was everyone's first collaborative work 
and we don't know how each of us works/do our thing.
What we can say is that for our group, we made sure that all requirements given were met and that we can present
a minimum viable product to our client, then work on the recommendations/feedbacks after such as on
which database does the client want to use, will it work from our perspective, the additional features the client 
would want, and the like.
Our group started the project early, and made sure that in every step, our project can be deployed smoothly. We tested 
deployment thrice. First, when all modules were completed except the API and activity; second, 
when all modules were completed; and lastly, when SQS was implemented. This was an huge advantage for our group, 
since we regularly check our deployment, we were able to avoid issues during the deployment of the entire project. 
This saved and gave us time to work on other details for the project such as transaction conditions, 
proper request responses, unit tests, and preparing for crud implementation (branch in repo).
